# The Hangman Game #

The original project provided by the course was to develop a Hangman game with a hard coded list of pre-selected words and no difficulty choice. To make the exercise more engaging for the user and to avoid using the same words repeatedly, I decided to categorize them by difficulty levels and fetch them from the Random Word API.
