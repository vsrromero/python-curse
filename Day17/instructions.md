# Quiz game

* Create a quiz game using OOP
* Your program must have the following classes:
    * QuizBrain - handles the logic of the game
        * TODO: asking the questions
        * TODO: checking if the answer was correct
        * TODO: checking if we're the end of the quiz
    * Question - handles the dictionary of the questions

## Extras

* Although the original exercise did not include questions fetched using the requests module, I decided to incorporate this feature to make the game more exciting and dynamic. Now, players will face a greater variety of challenging questions that will keep them engaged and entertained throughout the game.
