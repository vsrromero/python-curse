# 100 Days coding in Python project

Here you will find all projects done in this python bootcamp

## Achievements

Some additional features have been added beyond the request in the course; here you will find a list of them:

* Project day 17 - Instead of using a predefined list of questions for the quiz, as requested on the original project, a request to the Open Trivia Database (https://opentdb.com) was implemented. This ensures that the questions are always different, providing a more enjoyable experience.

* Project days 20-21 - The task was to maintain a track of the high score using code directly in the Scoreboard class. Instead of doing this, a separate class was created `ScoreTracker` to track the high score. Additionally, the implementation checks if the file already exists before creating a new file in the correct location. This allows the same class to be used in other projects that need to track the high score.

* Project day 23 - Implemented the score tracker to maintain a track of the high score using the `ScoreTracker` class, following the logic explained on days 20-21.
